>> + create a set of primitive elements in language - single data and procedures.
>> + create a set of rules for combining elenments of language.
>> + create a set of rules for abstructing elements - treat complex things as primitives.

> - management of complexity

>> + procedure and data abstraction
>> + conventionial interfaces & programming pradigms
>>> + manifest typing
>>> + streams
>>> + object oriented programming

>> + metalinguistic abstraction
>>> + layered languages for new problems
>>> + hardware/register languages
>>> + manipulation of programs compilation

> + evaluation rules æ±‚å€¼è§„åˆ

>> + primitive: numberal string boolean evaluates to itself.
>> + name evaluates to the value bound that name in the enviroment.
>> + combination is evaluated as:

>>> + evaluate the subexpressions in any order.
>>> + apply the value of the operator subexpression to the values of the remaining subexpressions.
>>> + define and lambda special form are special:
1. a define associates the value of the second argument with the name given in the first argument.
2. a lambda expression evaluates to a procedure object that stores both the parameter list and procedure body.

> + substitution model: to apply a compound procedure to its argument:  
__evaluate the body with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument__
